### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project has been completed utilizing Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are four questions that will change the answers:
    Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
    Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
    (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
    (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

Script also prompts the user whether they would like want to see the raw data. If the user answers 'yes,' then the script should print 5 rows of the data at a time, then ask the user if they would like to see 5 more rows of the data. 

Statistics Computed
  #1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    most common month
    most common day of week
    most common hour of day
  #2 Popular stations and trip
    most common start station
    most common end station
    most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
  #3 Trip duration
    total travel time
    average travel time
  #4 User info
    counts of each user type
    counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
    earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
